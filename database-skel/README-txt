
                    The database of the Neubot project
                       <http://www.neubot.org/data>

This file provides a brief description of the Neubot database published
on neubot.org website.  We publish the database both in sqlite3 and in
CSV format.

To understand what content of the database you need to read at least
the whole ``technical questions'' section of Neubot FAQs::

    http://www.neubot.org/faq#technical-questions

You should also review the history of the files that implement the
transmission tests.  At least, it is recommended that you look at the
history of the following files::

    https://github.com/neubot/neubot/blob/master/neubot/bittorrent/peer.py
    https://github.com/neubot/neubot/blob/master/neubot/net/stream.py
    https://github.com/neubot/neubot/blob/master/neubot/speedtest/client.py

In particular, you should at least take into account the following
nonexhaustive list of caveats:

1. the bittorrent test uses just one connection, while the speedtest
   test used to use two connections.  That was changed in 0.4.2 and
   now speedtest too uses just one connection;

2. the bittorrent test uses small messages, always measures at the
   receiver and doesn't start measuring immediately.  While the
   speedtest test uses bigger messages, measures the upload at the
   sender and starts the measurement immediately;

3. Neubot has used a fixed-size (262144 bytes) receive buffer for a
   long time, until that was reverted in Neubot 0.4.2.  Now each
   operating system is free to scale both the receive and the send
   buffer at will;

4. the speedtest test has been significantly modified and the current
   test is very very different from the one that shipped with the first
   public version of Neubot;

5. until version 0.4.2 clients were not attaching to the result the
   version number and the OS name.

You can ask information and report problems using the public mailing

Speedtest table
'''''''''''''''

The speedtest table contains one tuple for each transmission test.
Here follows the explanation of each field:

id
    This is the unique row identifier.

latency
    The average time required to request a zero-length resource via
    HEAD and get the response back.  This is measured in seconds.

timestamp
    The server's timestamp just after the measurement.

connect_time
    The average time required for connect() to complete.  This is measured
    in seconds.

privacy_informed
privacy_can_collect
privacy_can_publish
    Respectively: whether the user has read the privacy policy, whether
    she has given the permission to collect her Internet address, and
    whether she has given the permission to publish it.

    Of course we don't publish the internet address of users that have
    not given the permission to publish.  In this case we replace the
    address with <0.0.0.0>.

    The name `privacy_can_publish` is deprecated and will be replaced by
    `privacy_can_publish` in future releases.

download_speed
upload_speed
    Download or upload goodput.  This is measured in bytes/second.

uuid
    Unique identifier of the Neubot agent that performed the measurement.

internal_address
real_address
remote_address
    Respectively, the client Internet address as seen by the client,
    the client Internet address as seen by the server, and the Internet
    address of the server.

    Please note that internal_address and real_address are set to
    <0.0.0.0> if we don't have the permission to publish it.

neubot_version
    The version of the Neubot client that performed the test.

platform
    The software platform of the Neubot that performed the measurement,
    e.g. 'linux2'.

asname
country_code
city
    Respectively, the Autonomous System name, the country code and the
    city--obtained using MaxMind databases on the real_address Internet
    address.

    We add these three fields if and only if we don't have the permission
    to publish the Internet address.  Otherwise they are left blank.

BitTorrent table
''''''''''''''''

The BitTorrent table shares most field names and semantics with the
speedtest table.  The only notable difference is that the BitTorrent
table does not have the latency field.
